A continuation from part 1. This week I do two girls in one go!

Also please note the downloads section of the main web page. I have left a template with some example data from the Finance Tracking section a few episodes ago. 
Feel free to download the template and start using it for yourself. I plan on writing full instructions nad hints on how to use this.
