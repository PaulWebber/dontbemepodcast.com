A continuation from part 1. This week I do two girls in one go!
Unfortunately it's not as exciting as it sounds, it just means we cover S and C in this episode.

Also please note the downloads section of the main web page. I have left a template with some example data from the Finance Tracking section a few episodes ago. 
Feel free to download the template and start using it for yourself. I plan on writing full instructions nad hints on how to use this.
